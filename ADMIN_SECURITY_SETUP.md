# Admin Security Setup Guide - Jossie Fancies E-commerce

## üîê Security Overview

Your admin panel is protected by multiple layers of security:

- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Secure login with rate limiting
- **Session Management**: Auto-logout after inactivity (30 minutes)
- **IP Whitelisting**: Optional restriction to specific IP addresses
- **Audit Logging**: Complete tracking of all admin activities
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All admin traffic encrypted
- **CSRF Protection**: Prevention of cross-site request forgery
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute-force attacks

## üöÄ Quick Start for Client Access

### Step 1: Access Your Admin Panel

**Production URL**: https://jossiefancies.onrender.com/admin-login/

**Local Development URL**: http://localhost:8000/admin-login/

### Step 2: Default Admin Credentials

Your default admin account is created automatically during deployment. Check your Render environment variables for:

- **Username**: Set via `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME`
- **Email**: Set via `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL` 
- **Password**: Set via `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`

### Step 3: First Login Security Setup

1. **Change Default Password**: Immediately change your password after first login
2. **Set Up IP Whitelisting** (Optional but Recommended): See section below
3. **Review Security Logs**: Check the deployment logs for any security issues

## üåê IP Whitelisting Setup (Recommended)

To restrict admin access to specific IP addresses:

### Option 1: Single IP Address
In your Render environment variables, add:
```
ADMIN_ALLOWED_IPS=203.0.113.1
```

### Option 2: Multiple IP Addresses
```
ADMIN_ALLOWED_IPS=203.0.113.1,198.51.100.1,192.0.2.1
```

### Option 3: IP Range (CIDR Notation)
```
ADMIN_ALLOWED_IPS=192.168.1.0/24,10.0.0.0/8
```

### How to Find Your IP Address
1. Visit https://whatismyipaddress.com/
2. Copy your "IPv4 Address"
3. Add it to the `ADMIN_ALLOWED_IPS` environment variable

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Test IP whitelisting in a non-production environment first!

## üîß Environment Variables Setup

### Required Security Variables
```bash

# Session Security (Optional - defaults are secure)
SESSION_COOKIE_AGE=14400  # 4 hours
```

### Cloudinary Variables (Required for Images)
